# Programming Problems
Programming problems from Spoj and other websites. This repository was the main reason I did this crawler https://github.com/sohakes/spoj-crawler, so if you want to recover your problems from the brazilian Spoj website, you can use that too.

I don't think it makes sense to receive contributions on this repository, but if you think I could solve anything in a better way, if you don't understand something, need some help, or some other problem, just talk to me by email, opening an issue or whatever. I don't usually bite.
